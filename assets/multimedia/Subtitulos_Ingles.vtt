00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.840
Hello.
Hello.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.640
How are we doing?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:12.280
What a joy to meet again after so long
in this wonderful, beautiful place.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.760
Welcome, everyone, to the
highest authority in disco.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.120
No longer just in Latin America.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.480
Now we're talking about the
world, and you are making history.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.600
Let me tell you that we have all
the families of Mexico here with us.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.640
All eyes are on us.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.760
Thank you very much.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.880
Thank you for all the affection,
all the love you give to Polymarchs.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.375
We have quite a few surprises for all of
you, but first of all, I want you to give

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.840
me a big shout of good
vibes for all of you.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.720
And so, with that spirit,
with that enthusiasm.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's see, let's start off mischievously.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.920
But I also want to start with my great
friend, my inseparable Abel Rodríguez.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.560
Come on up, my dear Abel.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.000
Good evening, everyone.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.320
How are you?

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.415
Welcome once again to the place where
audio, lighting, and video come together

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.280
to create this impressive disco world.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.880
And what better place than here, in
the capital of the world, Mexico City.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.040
Let's go.
What are we going to hear?

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.000
A loud shout from all of
you on the count of three.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.520
Let's see how it goes tonight.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.920
One, two, three.
No!

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.960
You have to shout so
we can turn it around.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.200
With this shout to the whole planet.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.600
One, two, three.
OK.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.040
Well, let's get started then.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.255
On this stage we have a special guest who
will accompany me in hosting

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.920
this spectacular event.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.480
First, let's warm up our throats, okay?

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.360
You're going to help us.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.800
You can't hear the audio outside.
Yes.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.360
With a few.
With others.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.240
And you will feel.
Harder.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480
To peel.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
Rather, with everyone except me.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.320
Come on, harder, harder.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.000
For more than three decades.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.480
And it's not mine.
Me.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.640
They yell no at me.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.360
And if you hang out with everyone except
Benjamin and, if you're lucky,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.120
you like to laugh in front of you.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.895
You continue in your role as the happy
siren and lose control

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.120
with everyone except me.
Here we go.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.480
Here we go.
Come on, you have to pull harder.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:32.520
I have come to think more than once
that mocking me gives you pleasure.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.000
And that making love
with everyone except me.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.120
A round of applause for all of you.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.960
We begin with the magic of
the pharaonic Polymarchs.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.600
Let's welcome 2025 dancing and
break out the forbidden moves.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.320
Welcome, everyone!

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.320
This is how we begin.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.240
Check out this song.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.880
Polymarchs.
